Cancer Cell Detection Using Machine Learning

This Python-based machine learning model is designed to classify cancer cells as malignant or benign. Using the breast cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn, we apply three algorithms: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). After training each model, we evaluate and compare their accuracies to determine the best-performing model for this classification task.

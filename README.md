# Breast Cancer Cell Detection Using Machine Learning

This Python-based machine learning model is designed to classify cancer cells as malignant or benign. Using the breast cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn, we apply three algorithms: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). After training each model, we evaluate and compare their accuracies to determine the best-performing model for this classification task.

| Model                     | Accuracy    | 
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression       | 64.64%      | 
| SVM Model                 | 94.73%      | 
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | 91.22%      |
